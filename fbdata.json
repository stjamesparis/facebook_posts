In order to give parishes time for planning and discussion, the Bishop of Huron directs that all parishes in the Diocese of Huron remain closed to in-person worship until at least June 1, 2021. A decision will be made by the bishop in mid-May as to whether or not parishes may plan to hold in-person worship after June 1st.\n\nAlso announced today was a change to the numbers permitted at outdoor religious services, weddings or funerals.  A maximum of 10 people, including clergy and others involved in the service (but not including funeral home staff) will be permitted.\"\n\nPlease continue to reach out and connect with one another - love grows when we plant and nurture the seeds!","href":"https://www.facebook.com/1647096332177660/posts/2732074160346533/","time":"April, 17 2021"},{"message":"","type":"image","image":{"height":720,"src":"https://scontent-iad3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/s720x720/174777502_3877418275675731_5141042063242213246_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=PIjo3vl0KVgAX-BcoJr&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.xx&tp=7&oh=03584f302126f986ed11198dbb066921&oe=60A0641C","width":551},"href":"https://www.facebook.com/1647096332177660/posts/2732447556975860/","time":"April, 17 2021"}]}
