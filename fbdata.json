His conception had been supernatural, perplexing, affrighting; it had called for faith in the incomprehensible, and obedience beyond the limit of human power. His nativity was human and sweet, and the love with which she embraced it was a natural growth, inseparable from the thing she loved. She was blessed above all creatures, because she loved her Maker inevitably and by simple nature; even though it needed the swordâ€”wounds of the Passion to teach her fully that it was her Maker whom she loved. The Son of Mary is the Son of all human kind; we embrace him with the love of our kind, that we may be led up with Mary to a love beyond kind, a selfless love for the supreme Goodness, when we too shall have climbed the ladder of the cross.\n- Fr Austin Farrer","type":"","image":{"height":377,"src":"https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/132897242_2653656971521586_1843588891598215354_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=QwkvbrVUTssAX8_Mge3&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&tp=7&oh=827ec49f733fb30e05fb7919e45bd12b&oe=600C979E","width":720},"href":"https://www.facebook.com/1647096332177660/posts/2653657554854861/","time":"December, 24 2020"},{"message":"","type":"","image":{"height":720,"src":"https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/125845693_4636871109687382_4267407705030695929_o.png?_nc_cat=102&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=TVjOaWIleIkAX_H9Bi6&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&_nc_tp=30&oh=3295ab4b36b462ec826cbd9e016da374&oe=600BE73D","width":560},"href":"https://www.facebook.com/1647096332177660/posts/2653688044851812/","time":"December, 24 2020"},{"message":"St. James, Paris - YouTube","type":"","image":{"height":720,"src":"https://external-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQH2s4yifNMOXdJ4&w=720&h=720&url=https%3A%2F%2Fyt3.ggpht.com%2Fytc%2FAAUvwngTSTXPcIADmpDH6fsg_gPZdH0GLfA1j94rX7i3%3Ds900-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj&cfs=1&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQGnMwCqNZ5M6trn","width":720},"href":"https://www.facebook.com/1647096332177660/posts/2653691578184792/","time":"December, 24 2020"},{"message":"Christmas Eve (BAS - Modern) Holy Eucharist","type":"","image":{"height":720,"src":"https://external-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQGoCrYo8w3zAfG8&w=720&h=720&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FBsk711HQOi8%2Fmaxresdefault_live.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQGUo3BiKJhFwPvj","width":720},"href":"https://www.facebook.com/1647096332177660/posts/2653826108171339/","time":"December, 25 2020"}]}
